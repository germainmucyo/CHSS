# Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) on AES

This project implements Differential Fault Analysis (DFA) on the AES encryption algorithm. It includes a main DFA test and two extra credit tasks focusing on different fault injection models.

## Project Structure

- **dfa_aes.py** - is My main script for conducting DFA on AES, simulating fault injection.
- **extra_1_By_col.py** - Script for Extra Credit Part 1, performing fault analysis with a column-based model without specifying row information.
- **extra_2_8th_row.py** - Script for Extra Credit Part 2, performing fault analysis by injecting faults at the input of the 8th-round MixColumn stage.
- **Makefile** - Provides commands to run the different parts of the project and clean up temporary files.

## Requirements

This project is written in Python and requires Python 3. 
## Usage

### Running the Scripts

To execute each part of the project, use the following commands:
